### About Dataset
This dataset contains 119390 observations for a City Hotel and a Resort Hotel. Each observation represents a hotel booking between the 1st of July 2015 and the 31st of August 2017, including bookings that effectively arrived and bookings that were canceled.

### Insight:

The Hotel Booking Cancellation Dashboard provides a clear overview of booking patterns and cancellations. Key observations include:
1. High Cancellation Period: August shows the highest number of cancellations (5,239), indicating it as a peak month for booking adjustments. Cancellations are most frequent when prices are at their highest and least common when prices are at their lowest. Consequently, the price of accommodation appears to be the primary factor influencing cancellations.
2. Guest Type Impact: Couples have the highest number of cancellations (32,424), suggesting that targeting this segment with more personalized booking policies or incentives could be beneficial.
3. Hotel Type Analysis: City hotels experience significantly higher cancellations (33,102) than resorts (11,122). This may imply more spontaneous bookings or last-minute cancellations in urban areas.
4. Room Preference Impact: Guests desiring specific rooms are more likely to book, with only 29% cancellations from those seeking "desired" rooms, while "undesired" room cancellations stand at 39%.
5. Top 5 Country-Level Cancellations: Portugal (PRT) leads with 78% of all cancellations, followed by Great Britain (GBR) and Spain (ESP), suggesting the need for country-specific booking strategies.

### Recommendations:

1. Pricing strategies: Increasing prices are associated with a higher rate of cancellations. To mitigate reservation cancellations, hotels could refine their pricing strategies by offering reduced rates for specific locations and providing discounts to customers.
2. Targeted Marketing: Implement targeted marketing campaigns for high-cancellation months, focusing on retention strategies like special offers for August bookings as well as during January, hotels can launch marketing campaigns with attractive offers to boost their revenue.
3. Customer Retention Programs: Design loyalty programs for couples, offering perks that encourage commitment to their reservations.
4. Room Preference Incentives: Increase the desirability of "undesired" rooms by offering discounts or added benefits to balance booking preferences.
5. Country-Specific Strategies: Collaborate with travel agencies and partners in high-cancellation regions to develop campaigns that address booking concerns and reduce cancellations.
